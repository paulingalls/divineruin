## Prompt for Image Generation AI

A fantasy world map in the style of classic hand-drawn cartography, aged parchment texture with weathered edges. The map shows the continent of Aethos under existential threat.

**NORTHERN REGION (top third, heavily corrupted):**
- The Voidmaw: a massive wound in reality at the center-north, depicted as a swirling void or tear in the fabric of the map itself, dark purple and black with impossible geometry
- Shattered ruins of Aelindra surrounding the Voidmaw, the Crown of Aethos mountain peak broken and consumed
- The Ashmark: a clear boundary line marked with military fortifications, watchtowers, and warning symbols, separating corrupted lands (grey/black) from living lands (vibrant colors)
- Northern Reaches beyond the Voidmaw: isolated, desperate strongholds marked with fading colors
- Corruption spread: visual gradient from pitch black at the Voidmaw to grey at the Ashmark to natural colors in the south

**WESTERN REGION:**
- The Thornveld: massive ancient forest depicted with dense tree symbols, showing aggressive growth at the Ashmark's western edge as natural barrier
- Deeper forest areas with druidic symbols and ancient ruins

**EASTERN REGION:**
- Drathian Steppe: vast grasslands with nomadic clan territories marked, some northern territories greyed out (lost to Hollow)
- Keldara Mountains: dramatic mountain range with mining settlements, fortress-cities carved into peaks

**SOUTHERN COASTAL REGION (safe zones):**
- Sunward Coast: prosperous coastal cities with harbor symbols
- The Accord of Tides: major port city, clearly marked as population center
- The Greyvale: forested region between coast and Ashmark, marked with concern (corruption spreading)
- Dawnspire Highlands: elevated region with monastery symbols

**FAR SOUTH:**
- Pale Marshes: foggy wetlands with mysterious, obscured details
- Shattered Isles: archipelago with volcanic islands, detailed sailing routes between them

**MAP FEATURES:**
- Trade routes marked as dotted lines (northern routes severed, southern routes active)
- Divine symbols for each god's primary influence zones
- Distance scale, compass rose with ornate design
- Legend box with symbols for: cities, fortifications, Hollow corruption levels, divine temples, ancient ruins
- Annotations in elegant calligraphy noting key locations: "Site of the Sundering, Year 0", "Greyhaven - The Forty Day Vigil", "Last known safe passage"
- Water features: rivers, coastlines, ocean depicted in traditional map blue
- Elevation shown through artistic shading and mountain symbols

**ARTISTIC STYLE:**
- Hand-drawn medieval fantasy map aesthetic
- Worn parchment with coffee-stained edges
- Mix of top-down geography with some 3D mountain illustrations
- Ominous darkness bleeding from the north
- Southern regions vibrant but tinged with concern
- Artistic flourishes: sea monsters in ocean, decorative borders, dramatic title cartouche reading "AETHOS - The Sundered Veil"
- Color palette: aged browns and creams for parchment, deep greens for forests, blue for water, grey-to-black corruption gradient in north, warm golds for cities

**MOOD:** A beautiful world under existential threat, where you can see both the wonder of what remains and the horror of what's being lost. The contrast between the living south and the dying north should be stark and emotionally impactful.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the entire prompt section above** (from "A fantasy world map..." to "...emotionally impactful.")
2. **Paste into your AI image generator** (Gemini with Nano Banana 2, DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)
3. **Generate the image**
4. **Iterate if needed:**
   - If text is illegible, add: "with clear, readable text labels for all locations"
   - If colors are too muted, add: "with vibrant, saturated colors in the uncorrupted regions"
   - If corruption effect isn't strong enough, add: "with dramatic, stark contrast between corrupted and living lands"
   - If you want more detail, add: "highly detailed, intricate linework"

## Variations to Try

**More artistic/illustrative:**
Add: "in the style of fantasy book cover art, painterly, atmospheric"

**More cartographic/technical:**
Add: "precise cartographic style, technical map drawing, clean lines"

**Darker/more ominous:**
Add: "dark fantasy aesthetic, ominous atmosphere, heavy shadows"

**Lighter/more hopeful:**
Add: "with rays of light breaking through clouds in the south, hopeful undertones"

## Expected Output

The generated map should show:
- Clear geography of Aethos with all major regions labeled
- Visible threat progression from north (corrupted) to south (safe)
- Readable location names and annotations
- Artistic details that make it feel like an artifact from the world itself
- Both functional (shows where things are) and atmospheric (conveys the mood)
