### Milestone 1.1 — Attribute System & Core Resolution

**Goal:** Implement the d20 + modifier vs DC resolution pipeline as pure functions, returning narrative-ready result packets instead of raw numbers.

**Inputs:** Existing `rules_engine.py` with basic dice rolls, skill checks, and attacks.

**Deliverables:**
- Pure function: `resolve_check(attribute_score, level, skill_tier, dc)` → CheckResult packet
- 6-attribute model (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) with standard modifier math: `(attr - 10) // 2`
- DC scale constants: Trivial (5), Easy (8), Moderate (12), Hard (16), Very Hard (20), Extreme (24), Legendary (28)
- Auto-fail thresholds: Below Expert auto-fails DC 24+, below Master auto-fails DC 28+
- Proficiency bonus table: L1-6 (+1), L7-13 (+2), L14-20 (+3)
- Skill tier bonus constants: Untrained (+0), Trained (+2), Expert (+4), Master (+5)
- Result packet structure with narrative cues (margin of success/failure, critical flags, suggested tone)
- Tests for every DC threshold and edge case

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] `resolve_check` is a pure function with no side effects or DB calls
- [x] Modifier math matches `(attr - 10) // 2` for all attribute values 1-30
- [x] Auto-fail triggers correctly at DC 24+ for below Expert and DC 28+ for below Master
- [x] Proficiency bonus returns correct value for all 20 levels
- [x] Result packet includes margin, success/fail flag, critical flag, and narrative cue
- [x] All DC scale constants are defined and tested
- [x] 100% test coverage on resolution logic

### Milestone 1.2 — Skill Tier System

**Goal:** Implement the 20-skill, 4-tier advancement system with use-counter tracking and tier-unlock capabilities.

**Inputs:** M1.1 (attribute system and resolution).

**Deliverables:**
- 20 skill definitions across 3 categories: Physical, Mental, Social
- 4 tier definitions: Untrained, Trained, Expert, Master
- Use counter tracking with advancement thresholds: Untrained→Trained (8 uses), Trained→Expert (20 uses), Expert→Master (40 uses + narrative moment)
- Hybrid advancement: session use and async Training feed the same counter
- Expert unlock system: new capability categories per skill
- Master unlock system: signature always-active abilities per skill
- DB migration: `skill_advancement` table (skill_id, character_id, tier, use_counter)
- Pure function: `record_skill_use(character_id, skill_id)` → advancement event or None
- Pure function: `check_skill_capabilities(character_id, skill_id)` → available capabilities at current tier

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] All 20 skills defined with category, tier thresholds, and unlock descriptions
- [x] `record_skill_use` increments counter and triggers tier advancement at correct thresholds
- [x] Expert→Master requires 40 uses AND a narrative moment flag
- [x] `check_skill_capabilities` returns correct capabilities for each tier
- [x] Hybrid counter: both session use and Training increments share the same counter
- [x] DB migration creates `skill_advancement` table with correct schema
- [x] Tests cover all tier transitions including edge cases (counter at threshold - 1, at threshold)

### Milestone 1.3 — Resource Pools (Stamina & Focus)

**Goal:** Implement Stamina and Focus resource pools with archetype-specific assignments and recovery mechanics.

**Inputs:** M1.1 (attribute system), existing archetype definitions.

**Deliverables:**
- Stamina pool (martial abilities) and Focus pool (magic/mental abilities) per character
- Archetype resource assignments (4 patterns):
  - Stamina-only (full pool, no Focus): Warrior, Guardian, Skirmisher, Rogue, Spy
  - Focus-only (no Stamina, full Focus pool): Mage, Artificer, Seeker
  - Focus-primary (small flat Stamina ~4+CON, full Focus pool): Druid, Cleric, Beastcaller, Warden, Paladin, Oracle
  - Split (half Stamina, half Focus, both grow at half rate): Bard, Diplomat
- HP formula including CON modifier at half-rate per level
- Recovery mechanics: Short rest (Stamina full, Focus half), Long rest (all full)
- Narrative state indicators at resource thresholds ("winded", "concentration wavers", etc.)
- Pure function: `calculate_max_pool(archetype, level, attribute_modifiers)` → pool maximums
- Pure function: `apply_rest(character_state, rest_type)` → updated resource state
- Pure function: `get_narrative_state(current_pools, max_pools)` → narrative indicator string

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Each archetype correctly assigned to Stamina-only, Focus-only, Focus-primary, or Split
- [ ] HP formula uses CON modifier at half-rate per level and produces correct values L1-20
- [ ] Short rest restores Stamina to full and Focus to 50%
- [ ] Long rest restores all pools to full
- [ ] Narrative state indicators trigger at correct thresholds
- [ ] Resource pool calculations are pure functions with no side effects
- [ ] Tests cover all 12 archetypes and both rest types

### Milestone 1.4 — Experience & Leveling

**Goal:** Implement the 20-level XP progression system with unified milestone events and attribute increases.

**Inputs:** M1.1 (attribute system), M1.3 (resource pools for HP recalculation on level-up).

**Deliverables:**
- XP-to-level progression table (~100 XP per session average pacing)
- Unified milestone definitions: L4/L5 (specialization fork), L10 (power), L15 (mastery), L20 (capstone)
- Attribute increases at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 (+2 points each)
- Level-up event emitter: triggers narration events via DM agent
- DB migration: unified progression table (level → HP gain, attribute points, milestones, spell tier access, technique slots)
- Pure function: `calculate_level(total_xp)` → level
- Pure function: `get_level_up_rewards(from_level, to_level)` → list of rewards and milestones
- Agent tool: `apply_level_up(character_id)` → applies rewards, emits narration event

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] XP thresholds produce correct levels for all 20 levels
- [ ] Attribute increase events fire at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 with +2 points each
- [ ] Specialization fork at L4/L5 is flagged in level-up rewards

**Deliverables:**
- Training cycle state machine: initiate → first-half → midpoint decision → second-half → completion
- Activity types: spell study, recipe learning, technique training, skill practice, crafting, companion errands
- Variable duration ranges per activity type with micro-bonus variations:
  - Spell study (cantrip/minor): 5–9 hrs total, Spell study (standard/major): 7–11 hrs, Spell study (supreme): 9–14 hrs
  - Recipe study: 5–9 hrs, Technique training (base): 7–11 hrs, Technique training (mentor variant): 9–13 hrs
  - Skill practice: 5–8 hrs, Crafting: 7–11 hrs, Companion errand: 7–13 hrs
- Midpoint decision system: player chooses direction at cycle midpoint
- DB migration: `training_activities` table (type, target, cycle_number, first_half_duration, second_half_duration, state, decision_made, micro_bonus)
- Agent tool: `initiate_training_cycle(character_id, activity_type, target)` → creates training record
- Agent tool: `resolve_training_midpoint(training_id, decision)` → advances to second half
