# The Vigil of Greyhaven

*A short story set in the world of Divine Ruin: The Sundered Veil*

---

## Day One

The evacuation order came at dawn.

Sergeant Kael Thornridge stood in the center of Greyhaven's market square, watching the last of the civilian convoy disappear down the southern road. Carts piled with hastily packed belongings. Children crying. The elderly helped onto wagons by neighbors who'd been strangers a week ago. Three hundred souls, give or take, heading for the dubious safety of the refugee camps near the Accord of Tides.

Behind him, the town was already dying. Empty windows stared like hollow eyes. Doors hung open, revealing abandoned homes — meals left on tables, clothes scattered across floors, lives interrupted mid-sentence.

"Sergeant." Corporal Mira Ashfeld approached, her boots crunching on scattered grain from the overturned market stalls. "Perimeter's secure. North wall's been reinforced as much as we can manage. Still won't hold worth a damn if they bring a veilrender."

"They won't," Kael said, with more confidence than he felt. "Scouts say it's just drift and rend expressions. Shadelings and maybe a mawling or two."

Mira gave him a look. She'd been at the Ashmark for three years before this posting. She knew the difference between intelligence reports and reality. "Scouts also said we'd have two weeks before the corruption reached this far south."

"We have two weeks," Kael said. "We're buying it."

That was the mission. Hold Greyhaven for as long as possible, drawing Hollow attention away from the evacuation route. Give the civilians time to reach safety. Simple. Suicidal, but simple.

"How many stayed?" Kael asked.

"Seven of us," Mira said. "You, me, Thorne, Lira, Garrett, Daven, and Jorin. The rest went with the convoy as escort."

Seven. Kael had expected fewer. He'd made it clear this was a volunteer assignment, that anyone who stayed had a high probability of not coming back. Seven was more than he deserved.

"The watchtower?"

"Stocked. Food for forty days if we ration. Water for sixty. Ammunition for... well. Depends on how many show up."

Forty days. Kael allowed himself a grim smile. They'd be lucky to last four.

"Get everyone assembled," he said. "I want to brief them before we lock down."

---

Twenty minutes later, seven soldiers stood in the shadow of Greyhaven's watchtower — a squat, stone structure at the town's northern edge, built two centuries ago to watch for bandits and the occasional border skirmish. It had never been designed to hold against the Hollow. Nothing had.

Kael looked at the faces in front of him. Young, mostly. Mira was the oldest at thirty-two, a career soldier with scars that mapped out a decade of front-line service. Thorne was barely twenty, a Drathian recruit with the kind of earnest determination that usually got you killed in the first month. Lira and Garrett were twins from the Sunward Coast, volunteer militia who'd joined up after their village was consumed. Daven was a Keldaran miner turned soldier, built like a wall and twice as stubborn. Jorin was the quiet one — a former scout with eyes that never stopped moving.

"You know the mission," Kael said. "We hold this position, we make noise, we draw attention. We keep the Hollow focused here instead of chasing the evacuation convoy. Every day we hold is another day those people get farther south."

"How long?" Thorne asked.

"As long as we can."

"That's not a number, Sergeant."

Kael met the kid's eyes. "No. It's not."

Silence. The kind that settled over soldiers when they all understood the same truth and none of them wanted to say it out loud.

"We're not coming back from this, are we?" Lira said quietly.

"Probably not," Kael said. He'd never been good at lying to his people. "But we're giving three hundred civilians a chance. That's worth it."

Lira nodded slowly. Garrett put a hand on her shoulder.

"I didn't volunteer to die quietly," Mira said. "If we're doing this, we do it loud. We make them pay for every inch."

Thorne straightened. "Agreed."

"Damn right," Daven growled.

Kael felt something settle in his chest — not hope, exactly, but something close to it. Purpose, maybe. The kind you only found when you'd already accepted the worst.

"Then let's get to work," he said.

## Day Seven

The shadelings came first.

Kael watched from the watchtower's upper platform as the corruption crept through Greyhaven's northern district. The grass died first — green to grey to black in the span of hours. Then the wood began to rot, walls sagging, roofs collapsing inward. The stone held longer, but even stone couldn't resist forever. Where the corruption touched, reality softened, weakened, gave way.

And through the rot came the shadelings.

Dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. It was hard to count something that moved like smoke and had no fixed shape. They drifted through the empty streets, low to the ground, leaving trails of withered grass and blackened stone.

"Hold fire," Kael ordered. "Let them get closer."

The tower was stocked with crossbows, arrows, a few precious vials of blessed oil that Orenthel's priests had provided. Conventional weapons worked on drift-tier expressions, as long as you hit them hard enough to disperse the corruption holding them together. The trick was not wasting ammunition on targets too far away to guarantee a kill.

The shadelings reached the market square. Fifty yards out.

"Archers ready," Kael said.

Mira, Lira, and Garrett nocked arrows. Thorne gripped his crossbow so tightly his knuckles went white.

Forty yards.

The shadelings moved with no apparent strategy, no coordination. Just drift, as the soldiers called them. Floating, dissolving, reforming. The ambient sounds of the town — wind, distant birds, the creak of wood — began to fade. That was always the first sign. The world going quiet.

Thirty yards.

"Fire."

The first volley cut through the shadeling cluster. Blessed arrows struck true, and where they hit, the corruption dispersed — bursts of black mist dissolving into nothing. Three down. Four. Five.

The rest kept coming.

"Again!"

Another volley. More mist. More dispersal. But the shadelings were already at the tower's base, pressing against the stone, and where they touched, the rock began to darken, to crack, to crumble.

"Oil!" Kael shouted.

Daven hurled a vial over the edge. It shattered against stone, blessed flame roaring to life. Shadelings caught in the blaze shrieked — not a sound, exactly, but a sensation, a pressure against the skull — and dispersed.

The fire burned for twenty seconds. When it guttered out, the shadelings were gone.

Silence. Real silence this time, not the Hollow's unnatural quiet. Just the wind and the crackle of dying embers.

Thorne exhaled shakily. "That's it?"

"That's the first wave," Jorin said, his eyes scanning the ruined streets. "They'll be back."

He was right. They came back at sunset. And again at midnight. And again at dawn.

By the end of Day Seven, they'd used a third of the blessed oil and a quarter of the arrows.

Kael tried not to think about the math.

---

## Day Fifteen

The mawlings arrived on Day Twelve.

They were worse than the shadelings. Faster, more aggressive, and disturbingly purposeful in the way they moved. Humanoid shapes with too-long limbs and joints that bent wrong. Faces that weren't faces — just openings, tears in their surface that radiated localized dissolution fields.

Jorin spotted the first one at dawn. "Contact. North wall. Single mawling."

Then two more appeared. Then five. By mid-morning, there were a dozen circling the tower.

"They're testing us," Mira said, watching them from the upper platform. "Looking for weaknesses."

She was right. The mawlings didn't charge. They probed — feinting at the tower's base, retreating when met with arrow fire, circling to try different angles. One managed to scale the outer wall before Garrett shot it through the torso. It fell, dissolved, and reformed twenty feet away.

"They learn," Lira said quietly. "Gods help us, they *learn*."

By Day Fifteen, the mawlings had settled into a pattern: harass the defenders during the day, withdraw at night, return at dawn. It was grinding, exhausting, and clearly intentional.

"They're wearing us down," Kael said during the evening debrief. The seven of them sat in the tower's main chamber, exhausted, eating cold rations by candlelight. "They don't need to breach the tower. They just need to wait until we're too tired to fight."

"So we don't let them," Daven said. "We take shifts. Some sleep, some watch."

"We're already doing that," Thorne said. He looked like he hadn't slept in days. None of them had, not really. Light dozing, maybe, but nothing restful. The Hollow didn't allow for restful sleep. The sounds — the wrong sounds, the pressure, the dreams — saw to that.

"Then we adapt," Mira said. "We stop reacting. We start dictating terms."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning we go on the offensive. Set traps. Force them to fight on our terms instead of theirs."

Kael considered it. Risky. But staying passive was a losing strategy.

"What did you have in mind?"

## Day Twenty-Three

The trap was Mira's idea, refined by Jorin's scouting instincts and executed with the kind of desperate precision that only came from knowing you had nothing left to lose.

They used the market square. Lured the mawlings in with noise — Thorne banging on a metal shield, Garrett shouting challenges, anything to draw attention. The mawlings came, eager and aggressive, flowing through the streets toward the sound.

And then Daven triggered the collapse.

They'd spent two days undermining the supports of the buildings around the square, turning the entire block into a deadfall trap. When the mawlings reached the center, Daven cut the final support beam, and three buildings came down at once.

Stone, timber, and corrupted wood crashed down on the mawlings. The ones that weren't crushed outright were pinned, and the defenders moved in with blessed oil and fire.

It worked. Eight mawlings destroyed in a single engagement. The most successful action they'd taken since the vigil began.

But it cost them.

Thorne was too close when the collapse happened. A beam caught him across the leg, shattering bone. They dragged him back to the tower, Mira and Garrett hauling him between them while Kael and Jorin covered the retreat.

Lira, the closest thing they had to a medic, did what she could. Set the bone, wrapped the leg, dosed him with what little pain medicine they had left.

"Can he walk?" Kael asked.

"Not for weeks," Lira said quietly. "Maybe not ever."

Thorne, pale and sweating, managed a weak grin. "Still got my crossbow."

That night, the mawlings returned in force. Twenty of them. Maybe more. They threw themselves at the tower with a fury that felt almost personal.

The defenders held. Barely.

By dawn, they'd used the last of the blessed oil.

---

## Day Thirty-One

Jorin died on Day Twenty-Eight.

He'd been running a perimeter check when a hollowmoth swarm descended. The swarm itself wasn't dangerous — hollowmoths didn't corrode flesh like shadelings — but they were drawn to life energy, and where they gathered, worse things followed.

Jorin tried to retreat. He almost made it.

The mawling caught him at the tower's base. One blow, the dissolution field catching him across the chest. He screamed once — a sound Kael would hear in his nightmares for however long he had left — and then he was gone. Not dead. Consumed. Dissolved. Erased.

They burned what little remained.

Thorne volunteered to take Jorin's watch rotation, dragging himself up the ladder on one good leg and sheer stubbornness.

"I can still shoot," he said when Kael tried to argue. "That's all that matters."

By Day Thirty-One, they were down to six.

The food was almost gone. The water was rationed to a cup per person per day. The ammunition was critically low. Kael had stopped counting arrows after they dropped below fifty. Counting made it worse.

But the civilians had made it. Word had come via a supply runner on Day Twenty — the evacuation convoy had reached the refugee camps. Three hundred souls, safe.

The mission was complete.

They could have withdrawn. The runner had brought an extraction order: *Fall back if possible. You've done your duty.*

Mira read it, passed it to Kael, and then fed it to the campfire.

"We're not done yet," she said.

No one argued.

## Day Thirty-Seven

The hollowed knight appeared on Day Thirty-Five.

Kael knew what it was the moment he saw it. The gait was too smooth, too regular. The armor still recognizable — Ashmark standard issue, dented and corroded but intact. The face beneath the helmet was human. Had been human.

"Oh gods," Lira whispered. "That's... that's Corporal Tennin. From the convoy escort."

Kael's stomach turned. Tennin had been a good soldier. Competent, reliable. He'd volunteered for convoy duty specifically because he had family in one of the southern cities and wanted to see them again.

He hadn't made it.

The hollowed knight moved with eerie precision, circling the tower, testing defenses. Behind it came mawlings, shadelings, a seething mass of Hollow expressions moving in coordination.

"It's commanding them," Garrett said, horror in his voice. "It's using tactics."

It was. The hollowed knight directed the assault with disturbing intelligence — sending mawlings to probe the tower's weak points, holding shadelings in reserve, positioning itself where arrows couldn't reach.

The defenders fought like they'd been fighting for thirty-seven days: with desperation, skill, and the kind of grim determination that came from having nothing left to lose.

Daven took a mawling's blow to the shoulder and kept fighting, one arm hanging useless. Garrett ran out of arrows and switched to melee, dropping into the courtyard to engage the shadelings directly. Lira fought beside him, a short sword in each hand, moving with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd been killing Hollow expressions for three years.

Thorne, from his position on the upper platform, put a crossbow bolt through the hollowed knight's throat.

It staggered. Looked up at the tower with eyes that were still, horribly, human.

And then it spoke.

One word, in Tennin's voice, distorted and wrong: *"Run."*

Kael didn't know if it was a warning, a command, or the last fragment of who Tennin had been trying to break through. It didn't matter.

Mira put the second bolt through its skull, and the hollowed knight collapsed.

The remaining expressions scattered.

Silence.

Daven slumped against the wall, breathing hard. Garrett climbed back up the ladder, bleeding from a dozen cuts. Lira cleaned her blades mechanically, eyes distant.

"That's it," Kael said quietly. "That's everything they have."

"For now," Mira said.

"For now," Kael agreed.

---

## Day Forty

They didn't make it to Day Forty-One.

The veilrender appeared at dawn.

Kael saw it from the upper platform — a massive, lumbering shape moving through the corrupted streets, easily the size of a building. It didn't attack. It simply *existed*, and where it existed, reality broke down. The air grew thick, oppressive. Sounds stopped traveling correctly. The light took on a sickly, wrong quality.

"Everyone inside," Kael ordered. "Bar the door. Now."

They retreated into the tower's main chamber. Six of them, wounded and exhausted, huddled in the space that had been their fortress for forty days.

Outside, the veilrender advanced.

The walls began to crack. Not from impact. Just from proximity. Stone that had stood for two hundred years started to crumble, to soften, to give way.

"So this is it," Thorne said. The kid didn't sound scared. Just tired.

"This is it," Kael agreed.

Mira checked her weapon. "We held for forty days. That's forty days those civilians had to get farther south. Forty days the Hollow wasted on us instead of pushing the line."

"Forty days," Lira echoed. "Not bad."

"Not bad at all," Garrett said.

Daven laughed — a rough, pained sound. "They're going to sing songs about us, you know. The fools who held a doomed tower for forty days."

"Good," Kael said. "Let them sing. Let them remember that we were here, and we fought, and we didn't run."

The walls groaned. Dust rained from the ceiling.

"Weapons ready," Kael said.

They stood, the six of them, facing the door. Waiting.

Outside, the veilrender's presence intensified. The pressure built, a subsonic drone that made bones ache and teeth clench.

And then, with a sound like reality tearing, the tower began to collapse.

Kael had one last thought, clear and sharp: *We held.*

*Author's Note: The ruins of Greyhaven were recovered twelve years after the vigil, during a temporary Ashmark withdrawal. Scouts found evidence of the last stand: broken weapons, scattered armor, and the remains of the watchtower, collapsed but still standing in defect of the corruption that had consumed everything around it. The bodies of the seven defenders were never found. Their names are inscribed on the Memorial Wall at the Accord of Tides, alongside the thousands of others who have given their lives in the long war against the Hollow.*
